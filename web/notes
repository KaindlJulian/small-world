- sidebar can be grouped by property

- bottom of main area has controls for filtering, adjusting graph layout and adding more nodes and links

- different views
    - bridge view (find best bridges)
        - sidebar acts query-like
            - top, input start card(s)
            - middle, computed bridges
            - bottom, input target card(s)
        - graph shows
            - the start(left area) and end(right area) cards
            - the bridges between them in the middle area
            - this time no direct links for small world connections, but bridges as actual nodes in between, then connect them as 3 point connections
            - edges are the property that connects the cards, e.g. attribute, type, level, etc.
