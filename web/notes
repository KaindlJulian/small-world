- sidebar has list of monsters
    - item in list is just an image (and name)
    - list of components that have a hover state to show full card information
- sidebar can be grouped by property

- main area is force-directed graph of monsters
    - nodes are monsters (image + name)
    - hover over node shows full card information

- bottom of main area has controls for filtering, adjusting graph layout and adding more nodes and links

- different views
    - deck view
        - import deck list (ydke(e), plain text, link?)
        - graph of cards in deck
            - nodes are cards in deck
            - links small world bridges between cards
            - links shows icon of the bridge monster on hover
        - sidebar acts as decklist overview
            - on hover highlight card in graph and the cards reached via bridges
            - also quick stats like
                - cards without bridges
                - most connected cards
                - sort by amount of reachale cards, ref: https://small-world.yugioh-api.com/optimizer
    - bridge view (find best bridges)
        - sidebar acts query-like
            - top, input start card(s)
            - middle, computed bridges
            - bottom, input target card(s)
        - graph shows
            - the start(left area) and end(right area) cards
            - the bridges between them in the middle area
            - this time no direct links for small world connections, but bridges as actual nodes in between, then connect them as 3 point connections
            - edges are the property that connects the cards, e.g. attribute, type, level, etc.
