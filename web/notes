- different views
    - bridge view (find best bridges)
        - graph shows
            - the start(left area) and end(right area) cards
            - the bridges between them in the middle area
            - this time no direct links for small world connections, but bridges as actual nodes in between, then connect them as 3 point connections
            - edges are the property that connects the cards, e.g. attribute, type, level, etc.
